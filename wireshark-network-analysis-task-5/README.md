# Task 5: Network Traffic Analysis using Wireshark

## 🎯 Objective
Capture and analyze network traffic using Wireshark to understand core protocols like DNS, TCP, and TLS.

## 🧪 Steps Taken
- Installed and launched Wireshark
- Started capture on Wi-Fi interface
- Performed browsing and ping operations
- Stopped capture after 1 minute
- Saved file as `my_capture_task5.pcapng`
- Analyzed DNS queries, TCP handshakes, and TLS-encrypted packets

## 📋 Protocols Analyzed
- **DNS:** Resolves domain names to IP addresses
- **TCP:** Reliable delivery of web traffic
- **TLSv1.2:** Encrypted communication over HTTPS

## 📁 Files Included
- `my_capture_task5.pcapng`
- `network_traffic_analysis.txt`
- `README.md`
- `wireshark_summary.png`

## 🧠 Learning Outcome
- Understood how to capture live traffic
- Identified protocol layers and structures
- Learned how TLS secures communication
