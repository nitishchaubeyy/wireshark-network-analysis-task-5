# Task 5: Network Traffic Analysis using Wireshark

🔧 Tool Used: Wireshark 4.4.7  
🖥️ Interface Used: Wi-Fi  
📁 Capture File: my_capture_task5.pcapng  
📅 Duration: ~1 minute

---

## ✅ Protocols Observed:

1. **DNS (Domain Name System)**
   - Converts domain names to IP addresses (e.g., google.com → 142.250.182.206)
   - Seen in queries to domain servers over UDP port 53

2. **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**
   - Ensures reliable packet delivery
   - Used for HTTPS (port 443)
   - Detected SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK handshake pattern

3. **TLSv1.2 / TLSv1.3 (Transport Layer Security)**
   - Encrypts communication over HTTPS
   - Seen in "Client Hello", "Server Hello", and "Application Data" packets
   - Packet 15 (selected): Encrypted data from remote IP over port 443

## 🔍 Packet Example: Frame 15

- Source: 54.71.203.198  
- Destination: 192.168.0.100  
- Protocol: TLSv1.2  
- Port: 443 (HTTPS)  
- Application Data (encrypted)

## 🧠 Learning Outcome:

- Learned to capture and analyze live packets
- Understood packet structure (Ethernet → IP → TCP → TLS)
- Identified core internet protocols and their use
- Gained hands-on experience using Wireshark for packet-level inspection
